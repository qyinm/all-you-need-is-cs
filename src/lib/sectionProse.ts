    "The PDF emphasizes representations before algorithms. General trees can be written in list form where parentheses raise and lower the level, but fixed-size nodes are easier to implement. The left-child/right-sibling representation gives every node two links and shows why every general tree can be rotated into an equivalent degree-two, binary-style representation.",
  ],
  "5-2": [
    "A binary tree is either empty or consists of a root and two disjoint binary trees called the left subtree and right subtree. That empty-tree case, and the left/right order of children, are the main differences from an ordinary tree in this lecture.",
    "The key counting facts are central: level i has at most 2^(i-1) nodes, and a depth-k binary tree has at most 2^k - 1 nodes. In any nonempty binary tree, if n0 is the number of leaves and n2 is the number of degree-two nodes, then n0 = n2 + 1.",
    "A full binary tree of depth k has exactly 2^k - 1 nodes. A complete binary tree fills positions from 1 through n in the corresponding full tree, which enables array storage: parent(i) = floor(i/2), left child = 2i, and right child = 2i + 1 when those indices stay within n. Irregular binary trees use linked nodes with data, leftChild, and rightChild fields.",
  ],

    "Traversal is described by the relative order of left subtree (L), node visit (V), and right subtree (R). With left before right, the three standard orders are inorder LVR, preorder VLR, and postorder LRV.",
    "For the PDF's worked tree, the lecture writes examples such as inorder HDIBEAFCG, postorder HIDEBFGCA, preorder ABDHIECFG, and level order ABCDEFGHI. The important habit is to state the visit rule first, then trace the same tree without changing the structure.",
    "Recursive traversal follows a small template: stop at NULL, recurse left or right as required, and print the node at the V position. Iterative inorder simulates recursion with a stack: walk left until NULL, pop and visit the parent, then continue into the right subtree. Level-order traversal uses a queue rather than a stack.",
  ],
  "5-4": [
    "The additional operations in the PDF reuse traversal structure rather than introducing a new data structure. Copying a binary tree allocates a new node for the root, recursively copies the left subtree, and recursively copies the right subtree; NULL children remain NULL.",
    "Testing equality also mirrors the tree shape: two NULL trees are equal, two non-NULL nodes are equal only when their data matches and both left and right subtrees are equal. A node matched against NULL immediately fails.",
    "These functions are useful because they expose the core binary-tree recursion pattern: handle the empty case, do local work, and delegate the same operation to the two subtrees.",
  ],

    "A binary tree with n nodes has 2n child links, but only n - 1 of them are real edges, leaving n + 1 NULL links. A threaded binary tree replaces those NULL links with threads to useful inorder neighbors.",
    "The lecture's rule is: if leftChild is NULL, point it to the inorder predecessor; if rightChild is NULL, point it to the inorder successor. Extra tag bits such as leftThread and rightThread distinguish a thread from a real child pointer.",

    "The PDF introduces heaps through priority queues: a normal queue is FIFO, but a priority queue removes the item with highest or lowest priority first. Unordered arrays insert in Θ(1) but delete in Θ(n); sorted structures reverse that tradeoff. A heap gives O(log n) insertion and deletion.",
    "A max heap is a complete binary tree that is also a max tree: every node key is no smaller than its children. A min heap is the symmetric version. Because the tree is complete, the implementation uses an array starting at index 1.",
    "Insertion appends the new item at the next leaf and moves it upward while it is larger than its parent in a max heap. Deletion removes the root, places the last element in a temporary variable, repeatedly promotes the larger child downward, and finally stores the temp item. Both operations walk one root-to-leaf path, so their time is O(log2 n).",

    "A binary search tree is a binary tree where each element has a unique key, every key in the left subtree is smaller than the root key, every key in the right subtree is larger, and both subtrees are themselves BSTs.",
    "Search follows one path: compare the target key with the current node, go left if smaller, right if larger, and stop on match or NULL. Insert first performs this search; if the key is absent, the new node is linked at the last comparison point.",
    "Deletion has three cases: remove a leaf, replace a one-child node with its child, or replace a two-child node with either the largest key in the left subtree or the smallest key in the right subtree. Search, insert, and delete are O(h), where h is tree height; sorted insertion can make h = n, which motivates balanced trees such as AVL, 2-3, and red-black trees.",

    "Initial setup costs O(k). After outputting one record, only the path from that run's leaf to the root must be rebuilt, costing O(log2 k). Merging n total records with k runs therefore costs O(n log2 k) after setup.",

    "This app keeps §5.9 as a stable section even though the attached PDF's contents page jumps from selection trees to §5.10. The closest PDF-backed material is the earlier conversion from general trees to binary trees.",
    "A forest can be viewed as multiple disjoint trees; with the left-child/right-sibling representation, the roots and siblings can be chained using the same two-link node shape used for binary-style trees.",

    "The improvement is weighted union: store the negative size at each root and attach the smaller tree under the larger tree. This bounds the height of a weighted-union tree by floor(log2 n) + 1. Collapsing find then compresses every node on the search path directly under the root, making repeated finds much faster.",
